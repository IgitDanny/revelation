Revelation
==========

Hy -> reveal.js generator

Simple experiment to show hy and to write a presentation from your coding
fingers.

It can be used in two ways:

* Loading just revelation.hy you can just put a few functions together and get a
reveal.js presentation out of it.

* Using it with slides.hy you can use a more object oriented approach. This is
not pure yet and it will need to use revelation.hy to add any stuff that is not
a slide or a presentation.
